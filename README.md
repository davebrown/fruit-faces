# fruit-faces

## TL;DR

I have all these fruit face pics from preparing breakfast for my kids. I wanted to make an app to view them, and learn some new tech along the way.

Built with ReactJS, Dropwizard, AWS, and a cast of thousands.

Read the [about page](https://ff.moonspider.com/) of the deployed app for all the details.
